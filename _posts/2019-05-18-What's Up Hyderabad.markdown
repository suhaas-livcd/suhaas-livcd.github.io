Haha, today in hyderabad a super blogger Suhaas is born.

Blahhh. Baaaah!!!! just kidding I really don't find time.

I was just checking out jekyll. Its okie.

I did not like jekyll at start, as so many things to tweak and stuff, but now its kind of cool.

You can even write some some code snippets :

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Suhaas')
#=> prints 'Hi, Suhaas' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
