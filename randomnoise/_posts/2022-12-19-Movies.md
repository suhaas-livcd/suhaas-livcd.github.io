## Movies
- What type of movies I look for actually other than normal comedy (stress-buster) ?
    - For me movies are sometimes those **subtle moments** expressions that captures everything that a person wants to say. May be the character may not be dramatic but the nuances in the eyes and moments of his body can tell us a lot a things. This is what we are in real life, we know we are dramatic but in our head and we are alone. But question is are we alone ? No, we often are surrounded with people and parts of movies that cature those realistic moments only matter to me.
