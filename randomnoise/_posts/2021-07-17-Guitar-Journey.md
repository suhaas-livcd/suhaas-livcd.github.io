## About my little experience
I am playing guitar for 2+ years. I may not be the right person to guide but I would like to share whatever I have learned. I and still learning but I would like to connect and learn together. Please find below some resources that helped me.

## Resources
### Online Courses
- [Erich Andreas - Complete Guitar Lessons System - Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guitar-system-beginner-to-advanced/) this course would help you to know about guitar indepth differnt variations involved. In guitar there are so many different style of playing, and I feel it is very important to listen different sounds to get to know what we like to hear and play. This course will go through different techniques and help you in choosing the course you like.

- [James Testani - Good Guitarist](http://go.goodguitarist.com/complete-beginner-guitar-course-b) this course would help you develop rythm and basic songs. This is for beginners like me who started from scratch. The website is beautifull and responsive, with videos linked in youtube. The course is intresting if you maintain the consistency.

### Youtube resources

- [Marco Cirillo - FINGERPICKING GUITAR IN 7 DAYS](https://youtu.be/vDelH_f7HVI) will help you start if you are like me a fingerstyle enthusiast. I feel this is the course to start on that would help your fingers to **articulate**, alternate fingerpicking pattern, plucking strings together and using your thumb. Also at the end you can play a part of most famous melody [Asturias](https://youtu.be/D7lsJO3WOkA).<br><br>
