## About
[GestureTuneINN](https://github.com/suhaas-livcd/Android_Labs/tree/master/Applications/TuneINN) was designed on  with an intent to reduce accidents. Driver can reduce his actions and concentrate on course of driving. You can see the image below of BMW cars which supports some operation such as
- **Accept a Call** - Point to the BMW iDrive Touchscreen
- **Reject a Call** - Swipe Your Hand to the Right 
- **Turn the Volume Up** - Circle Your Finger Clockwise 
- **Turn the Volume Down** - Circle Your Finger Counter-Clockwise 
- **Change Rearview Camera Angle** - Create a Circle with Your Thumb and Forefinger 
- **Select Navigation/Custom Setting** - Point to the Touchscreen with Two Fingers

I am still supporting on this project in my company, our idea is to integrate Media controls with this for Audio and Video Players.  We integrated OpenCV in C++ with Androidâ€™s Native Development Kit to enhance performance. Based on the call backs, we perform the media operations.
