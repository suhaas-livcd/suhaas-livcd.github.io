## About
[Attendance Marking System (ATS)](https://github.com/suhaas-livcd/AttendanceMarkingSystem) was a support project that I was working for my friends for a very short time (perhaps 2 weeks). Initially, the stack was in ANDROID-PHP, later they deceided to move to [Apache CORDOVA](https://cordova.apache.org) because of initial cost setup and short timeline alloted for deployment reasons. After that ATS was orphaned, but I like this project thought subsumed under the theme [Digital India](https://www.digitalindia.gov.in) - to convert the traditional paper-based attendance logs to a digitalised central system.

There are two seperate login modules
- Student   : to schedule and view his subjects
- Professor : to log attendance, schedule assignments deadlines, view student birthdays.
