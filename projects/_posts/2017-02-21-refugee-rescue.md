# Refugees_rescue
  This is `Web application` for which would help refugees to connect the outer world and get support for their physical as well   as mental need. :)
  One of the biggest challenges in today's scenario is to take care and consideration of refugees to our society. Although       there have been so many social sites which give plenty of information but not in process of connecting as people suffer      through pyschological pain of need 
  - someone to share time
  - someone to provide shelter
  - someone to give work
  - someone to feel as their own
  
## Interface has two major componenets
  - `Volunteers Dashboard`
  - `Refugees Dashboard`
  
## Problems that we tried to address
  - Sharing things like Food,Clothes and some other products.
  - ![Share_items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suhaas-livcd/Refugees_rescue/master/ProjectScreenshots/Share.png)
  - To teach about Culture, Language and provide education or certification.
  - ![teach_items](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suhaas-livcd/Refugees_rescue/master/ProjectScreenshots/Teach.png)
  - To spend time by making appointments and adrress them
  - To know more about their whereabouts and analysis of them.
