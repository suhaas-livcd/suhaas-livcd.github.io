## About
  [Refugee Rescue](https://github.com/suhaas-livcd/Refugees_rescue) is `Web application` for which would help refugees to connect the outer world and get support for their physical as well   as mental need. One of the biggest challenges in today's scenario is to take care and consideration of refugees to our society. Although there have been so many social sites which give plenty of information but not in process of connecting as people suffer through pyschological pain of need 
  - someone to share time
  - someone to provide shelter
  - someone to give work
  - someone to feel as their own

## DashBoard at glance

### Refugee's View
  - In the refugees view, they would have option to connect with different refugees and share the skill. The idea is to get them certified by developing their skills, when the user applies for the post certificate is digitally signed using the [Signaturit](https://www.signaturit.com) API. This provides a sense of trust and proves to be authentic to the other person.

### Volunteer's View
  - A volunteer on the other hand, can share items and connect with other refugees. The idea is to learn, collabrate and teach them relevant skill set so that they dont stop learning.
