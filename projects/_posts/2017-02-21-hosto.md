## Hosto - A product of [Hosteloha Inc.](https://github.com/Hosteloha)
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/in--progress-code--not--updated-yellow"> [![Hosto_playStore](https://img.shields.io/badge/Playstore-Hosto--Beta-black??style=plastic&logo=googleplay)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hosteloha&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

[Hosto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hosteloha&hl=en_IN&gl=US) is the longest and biggest side project, that I am working right now. It is product hosting platform where users can bid, trade and sell stuff in their own vicinity. It is similar to the project [KarunyaForNeed (KFN)](/projects/karunya-for-need) which was setup in universities, however in this we are connecting resedential communities too and also we have upgraded the tech stack.

**Core Stack** : Spring Boot as Back End and Android for Front End. Apart from core, we used in between other technologies - FireBase for images,  authentication, notifications and in addition 3rd party libraries.

## Database
The database is a bit old school, we are using relational database using **mysql**.  This was our initial version but now it is has developed, bit more advanced internally, but the core modules remain intact.

| Module | Description |
| :---:   | :--- |
| *User Management* | Authentication, profile details, roles, follers, reviews |
| *Product*  | details, category, pricing, view, condition, tags |
| *Online*   | bid history, state, selling format |
| *Payment*  | coupons, payment options, transactions |
| *Delivery* | mode, special notifications |

I have designed it using [Vertabelo](https://vertabelo.com/), you can find it below. To understand deeply, open the model and understand sub-schema's linking, as it took for me substantial amount of around a week time in designing this stuff.
