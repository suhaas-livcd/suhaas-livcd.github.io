[Karaoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke), is a form of entertainment, offered typically by bars and clubs, in which people take turns to sing popular songs into a microphone over pre-recorded backing tracks.
When the user plays a track, we will show a special **"KARAOKE_MODE"**, when clicked will reduce the vocals and empasize more on the instrumental part along with displaying the lyrics.
The challenges here :
1. Sync On-Screen with lyrics (editor to sync time)
2. Synthesizing songs
3. Fetching lyrics
4. Recorder
