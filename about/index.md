# Hola üëã 

## What I think of code ? </>

My name is Suhaas Srinivas. Me and my code have been together from a long time. I wish I had met her a bit earlier ‚ù§Ô∏è To know about experiences, project works in detailed, please take a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](https://suhaas-livcd.github.io/cv/)

<hr/>

## A kindle üî•
I am coding from a long time, I first learnt about it in 2007, where they taught me in school [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic). However, I had trouble connecting the application in real life until it was in 2009 where I learnt HTML, CSS. It was interesting to code something and output turns up the way you intend to. Later, in 2010, my high school started teaching C language and I could not understand the different patterns using astricks * creating different pyramids and I felt it was mathematical and I enjoyed it. Later in 2013, I opted for bachelors in Computer Science and from that time I am reading and coding every other day.

## What is Computer Science for me ?
Uh! I feel its everything for me. I really respect the way it has changed and shaped the whole world.

<hr/>

## What's crazy is - this ubiquitous CS ?
I have worked on projects related to different domains such as Mobile, Web, Automotive and to some extent Emebedded devices too. For normal people who are not introduced to the realm of computer science, they would see things just the body like a television showing videos. But when I see, I get to see like an XRay, I see the Apps layout - horizontal scroll of apps or may be gridview of apps, for instance when I open Netflix - I see the UI, I see how they overlay buttons, I see how they detected the Intros, Recaps, I see so many other things that a mere eye cant see, even the database designs sometimes. I understand, for a civil engineers he sees buildings, but because of surrounding ourselved with so many technological devices, it is sometimes overwhelming to stop thinking about the technicality involved. This makes me digress from the actual content to the build of the serving container.

## What this website LivCode (livcd) mean ?
It was College-days, totally i was occupied with some or the other cool projects and that was my world, so something similar to Live-Love-Laugh, I made livcd(Liv-Code) as suffix in my username. After that I did not want to change, and still I cant think of anything better. Yeah, there are others things too I know, but this was kind of my addiction, my drive to build up things.

<hr/>

## What I expect ?
I am self-motivated and have drive towards theoretical learning and building up things, it would be a great pleasure for me to connect to people of similar minds and work on things. You can contact me if you want to learn or develop projects.

## Got any questions or a request !

You can try to post on [Discord forum](https://suhaas-livcd.github.io/forum/) or <a href="https://github.com/suhaas-livcd/suhaas-livcd.github.io/discussions">Github Discussion</a> but since the project is at an insipient stage, not many people are there to discuss and provide a solution. Also source code there on [GitHub](https://github.com/suhaas-livcd/suhaas-livcd.github.io), so you can also submit issues there. Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suhaassrinivas/)
